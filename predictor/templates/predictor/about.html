        <p>
            One of the most typical competitions that people who watch sports
            get into is a game of predicting outcomes. Many people even bet on
            various outcomes incessantly in the hope that their self-touted skill
            of being able to predict the future pays off. However, for me, it has
            always been a test of understanding the various factors in play during
            a game, and making good guesses.
        </p>
        <p>
            Based on this, I thought it would be interesting to have a platform
            where people can get together and play this common game with friends and
            strangers all over the world. As a first step, I created this website
            and chose association football as the first sport. Being the most popular sport
            and one that I'm infatuated with, it was an easy choice. I also chose
            the English Premier League to predict because it is probably the
            most followed league in the world, and definitely is within my social circle.
        </p>
        <p>
            Right now, there are no concrete plans of expanding this website, but
            the vision certainly includes expansion into other leagues and sports. I hope you
            enjoy Predictr!

        <p> Predictr has been desgined to be as simple as possible. Simply enter your predictions, click on submit,
            we'll take care of the rest. Make sure to get your predictions in before the matches for a gameweek start.
            Behind the scenes, a simple points system is in place that lets you compete against other people. Here's how it works..</p>
        <p>For each match in a gameweek, you can get up to 12 points. Points are awarded for each of the following correct predictions:</p>
        <p><b>Result</b> - If your guessed scoreline predicted the same result (home-win/tie/away-win) as in the match, you are awarded 3 points.</p>
        <p><b>Scored or Clean-sheet</b> - For each team in a match, if your guessed scoreline predicted whether a team will score or not correctly, you are awarded 1 point.</p>
        <p><b>Goals Scored</b> - For each team in a match, if your guessed scoreline correctly predicted the number of goals that a team scored, you are awarded 2 points.</p>
        <p><b>Exact Scoreline Bonus</b> - And finally, if you guess the exact scoreline of a game correctly, you are awarded 3 bonus points.</p>
