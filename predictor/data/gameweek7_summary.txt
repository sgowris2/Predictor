A week of draws
This week saw six draws out of ten matches, the highest so far this season. In fact, it was almost 7 draws if it wasn’t for Arsenal’s controversial last second winner. As a result, it turned out to be a great week for players who forgot to enter their predictions, with all of them scoring 36 points!! However, in general, people who did in fact enter their predictions did slightly better than 36 points. 

The shock of the week according to the predictions was Spurs’ victory over Manchester City, but with KDB having played an important role this season, there was a case to be made for a weakened Manchester City side playing away from home finding it difficult against a fluent Spurs side.
