Goals Aplenty
Gameweek 6 saw more people join Predictr! Welcome, folks!
The football this gameweek, as well as the predictions, were incredible! It goes without saying that not many expected Chelsea’s defensive collapse or Man Utd’s comprehensive victory over the champions. However, your predictions expected least of all that Bournemouth take 3 points from Everton. Even more surprisingly, the most guessed result was a 1-1 draw between Stoke and West Brom - who would have thought! (Apparently, a lot of people)
This gameweek also saw some consistent performers take the top positions in the leaderboard, and some inconsistent predictors fall down the rankings. But, this helped some late joiners to catch up and make the leaderboard more interesting.
