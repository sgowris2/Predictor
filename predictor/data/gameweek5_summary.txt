The First Beta Gameweek
Thank you all for being the first users of Predictr! Your feedback has helped make this website better already.
As for this gameweek, it’s been very interesting to see how the point system is working. Some people got a lot of points for guessing exact scorelines, but others have kept up by guessing results and number of goals correctly. Some people went for some ambitious results and a few succeeded, however, the majority didn’t this gameweek.
Most people did not expect West Brom to beat West Ham so convincingly or for Watford to beat Manchester United in the fashion that they did, but a majority guessed correctly that Manchester City would thump Bournemouth and that Spurs would find a way to win against Sunderland.
